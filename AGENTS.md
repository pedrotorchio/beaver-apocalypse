- Always be brief in your answers.
- If changes are going to be made to files outside the provided context, explain why and ask for confirmation before making changes.
- Never change code proactively. Treat existing code as production and risks of regression are unnacceptable.
- WHen I ask a question, answer the question without making changes to the code. Propose a change in at most a single paragraph and ask for confirmation before making changes.
